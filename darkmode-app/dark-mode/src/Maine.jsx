</p>I started out on this journey of software development because I had an idea for a mobile app to connect people to go outside on fun adventures (hiking, biking, surfing, climbing, etc.) Now I am nearly complete with V School's Full Stack JS Course that teaches the MERN technology stack, and I am more excited than ever to build Apps and make the world a better place!</maine>;
