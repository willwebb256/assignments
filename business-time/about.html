                In the summer of 2017 I went backpacking around Yosemite National Park with my friend, Cam. After a bear sighting, views from the top of El Capitan, and about 30 miles of hiking, we set up camp at the base of the valley. 

                I spent the evening sitting in a hammock under the stars, contemplating life and deciding on what to do with the next chapter of my career (which would eventually consist of Special Forces Selection, the SF Q Course, and an Afghanistan Deployment as a Detachment Commander with 3rd Special Forces Group). <br><br>
                
                As I finish this chapter in my life that consisted of nearly a decade of military service, I am excited to explore the vast realm of possibilities that exist within the technology field. I want to solve challenging problems and help others in need by contributing to society in a meaningful way. <br><br>
                
                As I began to transition out of the military, I started out building a website for connecting people to the outdoors called GoTrip (https://williamwebb256.wixsite.com/gotrip). This ultimately led me down the path towards gaining more technical skills in software development, an incredible internship with DFL Technology, as well as a part-time internship with TerraVerde Energy.<br><br>
                
                I am currently learning Full Stack Web Development through V School, and also contributing to a new startup hatched out of the WPMC Fund called Pleeb, which creates custom solutions for startups through Web Design and Development.
