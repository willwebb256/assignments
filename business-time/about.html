                GoTrip is an online marketplace for outdoor adventures. It aims to solve a major problem affecting Americans today: lack of time outside. Remaining primarily indoors can lead to complications with mental/physical wellbeing. Fortunately, even just a few minutes outside can significantly improve your mood and health. ​<br><br>

GoTrip connects people to find an outdoor experience near them, allowing people to look for or post an outdoor experience, ranging from hiking to ski lessons. My vision is to create a nation-wide marketplace for outdoor professionals, enthusiasts, and beginners who might need some support with finding their outdoor niche. ​<br><br>

GoTrip is inclusive to all community members and aims to get people outside participating in activities that are new and exciting for them, with the intention of partnering with organizations like Big Brothers Big Sisters of America and the DoD’s Morale, Welfare, and Recreation department. ​<br><br>

Additionally, the Outdoor Recreation Industry accounted for $374.3 Billion in 2020, meaning GoTrip has a substantial opportunity for growth and more importantly, an opportunity to improve the lives of many people by connecting them to the outdoors. ​<br><br>

​<br><br>

While the marketplace for GoTrip is being built, the best way to schedule an outdoor adventure is by email.

​​<br><br>

We are also building a GoTrip NFT Collection, based on a selection of my personal favorite outdoor adventures. They are minted on the Tezos blockchain, which creates clean NFTs  neutral due to its proof of stake method for verifying its blockchain.
