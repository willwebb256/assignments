And a glistening white mountain panorama ensures feelings of exhilaration. Let the adventure begin. With winter experiences at over 2,020 meters just waiting to put a smile on your face. Because one thing is certain: in Kühtai there is snow as far as the eye can see.",

You’ll also find locals and visitors winding down with a shaved ice after a day in the sun or shopping at boutiques filled with unique gifts that will allow you to bring back a piece of Hawaiʻi with you. Haleʻiwa is a far cry from the excitement of Waikīkī, and that’s exactly how the people of the North Shore like it.",
