                The first mathematical operation that students are introduced to in elementary mathematics is addition. To add means to bring together or combine two objects. Students then build over this understanding to learn how to add more than two numbers. In higher grades, addition is the basic element to understand more complex operations like multiplication and division. The addition has an infinite number of applications in our day-to-day life. We use addition while cooking food, while calculating bills at supermarkets, while calculating distances, and much more.
